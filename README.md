a skills kata for people learning kubernetes

## Host
```
  cd mining-exchange
  docker-compose up
```

## Players

### House Rules
- work in teams to build the best mine
- experienced k8s users are the 'consultants' and cannot touch the keyboard
- tampering with the application is against the rules! (Don't be a dick)

### Getting Started
```
minikube addons enable ingress
kubectl create 
```
